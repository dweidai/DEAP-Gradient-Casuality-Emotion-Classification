The basic idea of old JRP idea is the calculation of the synchronization index which describes the generalized synchronization between two systems. Each synchronization index is used recurrence plot to calculate along with embedded dimension calculated by the False Nearest Neighbors and the time delay decided by the cross-correlation method. In other words, the recurrence plot is the times at which a phase space trajectory visits roughly the same area in the phase space as at a certain time point. I want to achieve the same ideology of the MWRN, but using mathematics regression models. Given each channel’s EEG data as time-series data, I am proposing using ARIMA, vector autoregressions (VAR), or Granger causality. 

I have been trying to calculate the weight of influence between each channel with ARIMA. However, that came to a stand-still that many of the statistics do not apply. Two of the major pitfalls are ARIMA requires stationary data and EEG data, in this case, it isn’t stationary; and the other being the amount of computing time using the python library isn’t faster than the previous Recurrence Plot approach. 
Between VAR and granger Casualty, the VAR can be considered as a means of conducting causality tests, or more specifically Granger causality tests. The VAR model shows that one EEG channel has an influence on the other given channel; however Granger causality really implies a correlation between the current value of one variable and the past values of others, it does not mean changes in one variable cause changes in another. 

Then, I am intrigued by this paper published in 2013 by Journal Neuroscience of Methods, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3719213/ . This paper talks about the utilization of Granger Causality analyzation on the influence between EEG channels.
